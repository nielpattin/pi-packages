# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added `cfut_` token recognition to Cloudflare credential parser alongside existing `cfat_` support, so pasted Workers AI tokens are handled by the Cloudflare-specific parser instead of falling through to the generic fallback.
- Added `resolveCloudflareRequestOverridesFromText` call in the generic API key fallback parser to extract account IDs and base URLs from surrounding text, so credential request overrides are applied even when the generic parser handles the input.

### Fixed

- Fixed `session_start` reload handler not awaiting `registerMultiAuthProviders()`, which caused a race condition where `resetApiProviders()` during `reload()` wiped provider wrappers and the next API call hit before async re-registration completed, producing "Invalid URL" errors (OpenAI SDK received literal `managed-by-multi-auth` as baseURL).
- Reduced API provider safety-net re-registration interval from 30s to 1s so wrappers are restored faster after any external `resetApiProviders()` call path not covered by the session_start handler.
- Resolved oxlint errors reported by the repository pre-commit hook (`no-unused-vars`, `no-useless-spread`, `no-useless-fallback-in-spread`, `no-useless-escape`, `no-useless-default-assignment`, `no-redundant-type-constituents`, `restrict-template-expressions`, `require-array-sort-compare`) by removing unused imports, dropping redundant spreads and spread fallbacks, reordering structural-symbol regex character classes so `[` is not the first member (the `\[` escape was a `no-useless-escape` false positive but removing it broke the `u`-flag regex), and adding a compare function to the compiled-test sort. Behavior is unchanged; the reordered regexes were verified to match the same character set.

## 0.10.0 - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added delegated auth broker support with `PI_DELEGATED_AUTH_*` runtime environment variables and legacy fallback handling.
- Added retry-budget and half-open probe controls for credential balancing, token-weighted usage accounting, and background exclusion handling for credentials missing refresh tokens.
- Added backup recovery, atomic writes, and Windows ACL hardening for credential and state file persistence.
- Added persistent usage cache and usage coordinator robustness improvements, import handling updates, and longer Codex usage request timeouts.

### Changed

- Improved provider retry behavior with jittered exponential backoff, abortable sleeps, retry-budget integration, and token-estimate-aware success recording.
- Updated OAuth command flows for missing refresh token messaging and OmniOnboard naming.
- Widened Pi peer dependency compatibility to include Pi 0.77.x and 0.78.x and updated development tooling.

### Fixed

- Decayed stale quota errors over time with success-streak recovery so recovered credentials can return to rotation.
- Improved auth writer and storage recovery from partial or corrupted snapshots.

### Removed

- Removed unused carousel and quota bar formatter code.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Added process-scoped credential leases that track which credentials are held by each running process, preventing concurrent credential reuse across parallel Pi sessions while allowing shared-lease fallback when no unleased alternatives exist.
- Added `ProviderCredentialLeaseState` type and `credentialLeases` field on `ProviderRotationState` in `multi-auth.json` for persistent lease tracking.
- Added automatic migration of legacy per-provider rotation modes from `multi-auth.json` to `config.json` `rotationModes` on first initialization, preserving user overrides.
- Added exhausted-quota credential detection in the multi-auth modal that marks credentials with five or more consecutive quota errors and a lingering `lastQuotaError` as "Exhaust" instead of "Ready".
- Added `enqueueAllCredentialUsageRefresh` for bulk usage refresh scheduling across all provider credentials.

### Changed

- Simplified `config.json` to expose only `debug`, `hiddenProviders`, and `rotationModes` configuration keys; removed `excludeProviders`, `cascade`, `health`, `historyPersistence`, `modelEntitlements`, `oauthRefresh`, and `usageCoordination` keys from the user-facing configuration surface.
- Moved hidden-provider state from `multi-auth.json` `ui.hiddenProviders` to `config.json` `hiddenProviders` so provider visibility survives `multi-auth.json` resets.
- Moved cascade, health, OAuth-refresh, and usage-coordination configuration to internal defaults so the extension no longer depends on user-facing configuration for subsystem tuning.
- Updated Codex OAuth refresh lead time to five minutes to reduce last-second token refresh failures.
- Widened Pi peer dependency ranges to `^0.74.0 || ^0.75.0` and bumped dev dependencies to `^0.75.5`.

### Removed

- Removed `src/history-storage.ts` module and `MultiAuthHistoryStore`; health and cascade history persistence is no longer user-configurable.
- Removed `MultiAuthUiState` interface and `ui` top-level key from `MultiAuthState` in `multi-auth.json`.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Added first-class Kimi For Coding OAuth login using device code flow with token refresh support.
- Added first-class Qwen OAuth login using device code flow with PKCE, resource-URL base-URL discovery, and token refresh.
- Added Kimi For Coding usage/quota provider that fetches rate-limit windows from the `/usages` endpoint with timed and untimed window classification.
- Added BlazeAPI usage/quota provider (`src/usage/blazeapi.ts`) that fetches plan limits (`daily_requests`, `premium_daily_credits`, `rate_limit_rpm`, `expires_at`), daily request counters, and premium credit consumption from `GET /api/usage` using `Authorization: Bearer blz_*`. Translates the counters into the shared `RateLimitWindow` primary (daily requests) and secondary (premium credits) windows with a UTC-midnight reset estimate, surfaces the remaining premium credit balance via `UsageCredits`, and routes through the existing `quotaClassifier` and `usageCoordinator` pathways. Verified live against `https://blazeai.boxu.dev/api/usage`.
- Added a backward-compatible parser fallback for the legacy `/api/account` flat usage shape (numeric `usage.today` with a sibling `usage.premium_used`) so the provider keeps working if BlazeAPI rolls back to that response format.
- Added `blazeapi: "BlazeAPI"` to `API_KEY_LOGIN_PROVIDER_DISPLAY_NAMES` so BlazeAPI appears in the API-key credential setup dialog with a friendly display name, and registered `blazeapiUsageProvider` in `src/usage/providers.ts`, which auto-enables `hasExternalAccountState: true` and the standard rotation profile via `provider-rotation-profile.ts`.
- Added `tests/blazeapi-usage.test.ts` covering provider registration, Pro plan parsing against the live `/api/usage` payload shape, Free plan parsing with zero premium credits, credential-scoped `baseUrl` normalization (stripping `/v1/chat/completions` suffixes), legacy `/api/account` shape fallback, 401 token-expiration handling, and missing-plan-limit rejection.
- Added BlazeAPI model-plan eligibility routing in `src/model-entitlements.ts`: `BlazeApiPlanType`, `normalizeBlazeApiPlanType`, `isBlazeApiPlanEligibleForPremiumModel`, and a curated set + regex patterns for premium-credit-charging models (`claude-opus-*`, `claude-sonnet-*`, `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6`, `qwen/qwen3.5-397b`, `z-ai/glm-5.1`). `modelRequiresEntitlement` now routes through BlazeAPI logic for the `blazeapi` provider so premium-charging models auto-route to `Pro`/`Premium` credentials (where `premium_daily_credits > 0`).
- Added BlazeAPI plan-tier routing via `rankBlazeApiCredentialsByPlanTier`, `providerUsesPlanTierRanking`, and a new `preferredCredentialTiers` field on `CredentialModelEligibility`. BlazeAPI credentials are ranked Premium → Pro → Free for every model call: higher tiers receive faster server-side pool priority and are tried first; when an active tier exhausts its `daily_requests` (primary) or `premium_daily_credits` (secondary) budget, rotation automatically falls back to the next tier and finally to the catch-all eligible set. This reverses the prior conservation-oriented preference (which routed free-tier models to Free credentials) in favor of "benefit from the highest plan first, fall back as quotas exhaust."
- Added BlazeAPI-aware `normalizeBlazeApiModelId` that preserves vendor namespaces (`moonshotai/`, `z-ai/`, `qwen/`) and only strips the leading `blazeapi/` provider prefix, so namespaced model IDs configured in `settings.json` (e.g. `blazeapi/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6`) match the entitlement catalog correctly. Fixed a latent bug where `resolveCredentialModelEligibility` was passing the codex-normalized (namespace-stripped) model id to entitlement helpers, which prevented BlazeAPI namespaced premium models from triggering entitlement filtering at runtime.
- Added a BlazeAPI-specific failure message in `resolveCredentialModelEligibility` when no `Pro`/`Premium` credential is available: _“No BlazeAPI credentials with premium daily credits available for … Upgrade to BlazeAPI Pro or Premium, or add a Pro/Premium credential to call premium-charging models.”_
- Added a generalized multi-pass selection loop in `AccountManager.acquireCredential` that consumes `preferredCredentialTiers` when present: each non-empty tier is tried as its own selection pass (with the configured rotation mode applied within the tier) before falling back to the next tier, ending in the catch-all `available` pass. Existing single-tier `preferredCredentialIds` consumers (codex) keep working unchanged.
- Added `tests/blazeapi-entitlement.test.ts` cases covering: `providerUsesPlanTierRanking`, `rankBlazeApiCredentialsByPlanTier` ordering with trailing unknown-plan bucket, premium-charging model selects Premium first, free-tier model selects Premium first (server-side priority benefit), Premium-exhausted free-tier model falls back to Pro, Premium+Pro-exhausted free-tier model falls back to Free, premium-credit-exhausted Premium credential falls back to Pro for premium-charging models, BlazeAPI-specific failure message when no premium tier is reachable, and the asserted-removal of the old `modelPrefersFreePlan` BlazeAPI preference.
- Added provider capability matrix to README documenting API key, OAuth, and usage/quota support for all recognized providers.
- Added environment variable documentation and `.env.example` template for OAuth client overrides, runtime path overrides, and display overrides.

### Changed

- Updated README OAuth provider coverage to list supported first-class OAuth providers: Cline, Kilo, Kimi For Coding, and Qwen.
- Added BlazeAPI to the README provider capability matrix as an API-key provider with usage/quota support.
- Changed the BlazeAPI default rotation mode to `usage-based` in `resolveDefaultRotationMode`, matching the `openai-codex` default, so newly-added BlazeAPI provider state starts in usage-based rotation. Existing persisted `rotationMode` in `multi-auth.json` is preserved; the live workspace state file was migrated separately from `round-robin` to `usage-based` so the rotation now respects per-credential premium-credit consumption.
- Updated package metadata, published file list, and lockfile version to `0.8.0`, including `.env.example` so the README-linked environment template is included in the package.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Added first-class Kilo OAuth device authorization, refresh handling, and Kilo editor request headers for model calls.
- Added Cloudflare Workers AI credential parsing for pasted `cfat_` tokens, account IDs, dashboard token URLs, and full account-scoped base URLs.

### Changed

- Updated Cloudflare Workers AI setup to discover account-scoped OpenAI-compatible base URLs when a token can list exactly one account, with actionable fallback guidance when manual selection is required.
- Removed legacy Google Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity provider handling from usage refresh and credential setup paths.
- Updated package metadata and lockfile version to `0.7.0` for release preparation.

### Fixed

- Improved Cloudflare credential identity resolution so existing credentials can derive account context from request overrides or token discovery instead of relying on stale provider metadata.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added a guided provider configuration dialog for API-key and OAuth setup that separates configured and available providers, supports search, and preserves credential-count context.
- Added API-key provider discovery from Pi built-ins, `models.json`, and known `auth.json` credentials so supported providers can be selected before credentials exist.
- Added delegated credential pinning for parent-session credential reuse with explicit unavailable and model-entitlement diagnostics.

### Changed

- Refined the account manager modal to show visible account counts, alias/account columns, and color-highlighted plan details.
- Updated Cloudflare Workers AI daily allocation classification to infer UTC reset windows and reconcile persisted cooldown state from saved quota errors.
- Updated Pi development dependencies and lockfile entries to `0.70.6` for release preparation.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Updated OpenAI Codex account selection to prefer fresh or durable cached usage evidence before scheduling bounded background refreshes, reducing selection latency while preserving quota-aware routing.
- Refined usage coordination with rotating candidate windows, preferred credential cache keys, and cache disambiguation for reused Codex credential ids.
- Updated Codex paid-entitlement checks to use durable negative usage evidence without forcing a fresh bootstrap when cached plan data is authoritative.
- Added explicit Codex usage request timeouts, including IPv4 fallback timeout handling, so stalled usage probes fail with clear diagnostic errors.
- Updated package metadata and lockfile version to `0.5.0` for release preparation.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Added per-credential request overrides for provider base URLs and headers, including Cloudflare Workers AI account-scoped base URL validation and account discovery for Cloudflare API-key credentials.
- Added provider response diagnostics for status-only OpenAI-compatible failures so authentication, permission, billing, and rate-limit errors can surface provider status codes, codes, messages, and operator actions.
- Added persistent usage snapshot caching under Pi's runtime directory with display-only last-known entries for warm starts and degraded usage visibility.
- Added coordinated usage refresh admission control with global and per-provider concurrency limits, operation-specific candidate windows, account/provider cooldowns, and circuit breakers.

### Changed

- Updated usage selection, blocked-account reconciliation, startup refinement, modal refresh, and manual refresh flows to share the persistent cache and usage coordinator instead of issuing unbounded fresh usage requests.
- Centralized local development runners so lint emits a stable empty JSON result on success and compiled tests are discovered from `.test-dist/tests` automatically.
- Updated package metadata and lockfile version to `0.4.0` for release preparation.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-25

### Added

- Added first-class Cline OAuth registration, browser callback handling, token exchange, token refresh, WorkOS request secret formatting, and Cline client request headers.
- Added Cline credential identity deduplication and Cline-specific token expiration handling for proactive refresh scheduling.
- Added delegated runtime credential override handling and explicit lightweight parent-session lease release support.

### Changed

- Updated package compatibility metadata to Pi 0.70.x packages.
- Preserved still-active Cline OAuth tokens when refresh failures are permanent but the current access token remains usable.
- Hardened startup, shutdown, abort, and credential lookup paths with shared structured error helpers.

### Fixed

- Skipped expired JWT-backed API key credentials during Cline selection and surfaced clear re-authentication errors for expired manual selections.
- Ensured Cline OAuth request secrets are formatted consistently without requiring runtime OAuth registry state.
- Prevented stale lightweight leases from surviving cooldown and parent-session release flows.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Added lightweight rotation support for non-OAuth providers, including provider-agnostic rotation classification, staged state flushing, and parent-session lease reuse in the key distributor.
- Added configurable Codex entitlement handling for usage lookup failures together with extracted health and cascade history persistence for provider state.

### Changed

- Updated startup and session lifecycle handling so warmup begins on `session_start`, reloads refresh extension config, and delegated runtimes resolve state paths through Pi's agent runtime directory.
- Updated package compatibility metadata to Pi 0.68.1 and documented the `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`-aware global install path.

### Fixed

- Preserved caller-initiated abort semantics during rotated requests while keeping retries limited to extension-owned timeout cases.
- Improved OAuth refresh failure summaries and quota cooldown persistence, including rate-limit-derived exhaustion windows and provider metadata refresh after `models.json` changes.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-04-01

### Changed

- Enhanced package discoverability with aligned npm keywords for better searchability.
- Added npm and GitHub repository links in `package.json` and `README.md` for package discoverability.
- Added Related Pi Extensions cross-linking section in README for ecosystem navigation.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- Preserve `StreamAttemptTimeoutError` identity when abort signals propagate through generic `AbortError` surfaces. Timeout-triggered aborts now correctly surface the original timeout error context instead of wrapping it in generic abort messages.
- Properly distinguish caller-initiated aborts from timeout-triggered aborts to ensure caller aborts remain terminal without retry looping.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-03-31

### Changed

- Added public-repository packaging metadata and published file selection for the extension package.
- Added repository artifacts for open-source distribution: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `.npmignore`, and TypeScript project configs.
- Kept the runtime entrypoint and existing source import layout unchanged to preserve extension behavior.
