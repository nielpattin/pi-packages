/**
 * Whole-message sentinel placeholder for providers that DO NOT filter
 * empty assistant content out of their wire payload.
 *
 * Background: when `stripDroppedPlaceholderMessages` /
 * `stripSystemInjectedMessages` / `replaySentinelByMessageIds` reduce a
 * whole assistant message to one sentinel part, the resulting AI-SDK
 * `ModelMessage` becomes `{ role: "assistant", content: "" }`. Anthropic
 * and Bedrock filter such empty messages out via their `normalizeMessages`
 * step (see Host's `provider/transform.ts:55-73`), so the wire never
 * sees them. Most other providers (openai-compatible, openrouter, google,
 * ...) do not, and the empty-content message reaches the wire — and is
 * rejected by stricter backends (e.g. Moonshot/Kimi: "must not be empty").
 *
 * Using a non-empty placeholder text whose value won't be filtered keeps
 * the wire valid while still telling the model honestly that something
 * was dropped. For Anthropic/Bedrock we still emit `""` so their existing
 * filter continues removing the message — no wire-shape change for them.

 * Decide whether a model accepts empty assistant `content` on the wire.

 * filters out empty text/reasoning/messages BEFORE they reach the
 * provider, so an empty sentinel is safe AND lets the message disappear
 * from the wire entirely (a small token-count optimization).
 *
 * Rule: only the canonical `anthropic` provider. Everything else gets the
 * non-empty `[dropped]` placeholder.
 *
 * Trade-off: providers that ALSO filter empties but aren't the canonical
 * Anthropic provider (e.g. Bedrock, Google-Vertex Anthropic) will see
 * `[dropped]` here instead of `""`. Their filter doesn't remove non-empty
 * content, so the message stays on the wire — one cache bust on rollout,
 * then stable. Acceptable given the alternative is broader matching that
 * risks misclassifying non-filter providers as filter-friendly (which
 * would re-introduce the empty-message rejection bug we're fixing).

/**
 * Create an empty-text sentinel to replace a stripped message PART (not a
 * whole message) while preserving the array's length and index positions
 * across passes.
 *
 * For per-part sentinelization, empty text is always safe — the message
 * still has other content (text/tool/reasoning) so it never reaches the
 * wire as an empty assistant message.
 *
 * Why sentinels exist: some providers (Antigravity/Gemini-routed-Claude,
 * some OpenRouter configs) hash the full serialized messages[] array as
 * their prompt-cache key. Any array-length change between turns busts the
 * cache. Replacing removed parts with inert `{type:"text", text:""}`
 * placeholders keeps the array shape stable so subsequent turns can hit
 * cache on the unchanged prefix.
 *
 * For Anthropic/Bedrock/Google-SDK providers, `provider/transform.ts:55-73`
 * (or the SDK itself) filters out parts where `text === ""`, so the
 * sentinel never reaches the wire. Wire behavior stays identical to the
 * previous `.filter()`/`.splice()` behavior.
 *
 * `cache_control` inheritance: if the original part carried provider-side
 * cache-breakpoint metadata (`cache_control` / `cacheControl`), the
 * sentinel inherits it. Host currently only sets cache markers on the
 * last two system+non-system messages (never on mid-history parts we
 * strip), so this is defensive, but cheap.
