/**
 * Pi-side `todowrite` tool.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * Host ships a built-in `todowrite` tool that the agent uses to manage
 * work-tracking state. Magic Context captures that state in
 * `session_meta.last_todo_state` via the `tool.execute.after` hook so the
 * synthetic-todowrite injector can resurface it across cache-busts.
 *
 * Pi-coding-agent has NO built-in `todowrite` — Pi treats todo management
 * as an extension concern (see `pi-mono/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/todo.ts`
 * for a community example). That means:
 *   1. The Pi LLM won't see a `todowrite` tool unless something registers it.
 *   2. Without registration, the agent can't emit `todowrite` calls, so
 *      synthetic-todowrite injection has nothing to surface.
 *   3. e2e tests can't drive the capture path either.
 *
 * Magic Context provides a built-in `todowrite` to close this parity gap.
 * The tool is intentionally minimal: it accepts the same `{ todos: [...] }`
 * shape Host uses, returns a pretty-printed JSON acknowledgement
 * (matching Host's `todo.ts` output), and lets the message_end capture
 * path in `index.ts` snapshot the args into `session_meta.last_todo_state`.
 *
 * Wire-shape parity verified against:
 *   - Host source: `~/Work/OSS/host/packages/host/src/tool/todo.ts`
 *   - Synthetic part shape: `core/hooks/magic-context/todo-view.ts`
