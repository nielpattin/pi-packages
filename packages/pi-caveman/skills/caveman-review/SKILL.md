   Ultra-compressed code review comments. Cuts noise from PR feedback while preserving
   the actionable signal. Each comment is one line: location, problem, fix. Use when user
   says "review this PR", "code review", "review the diff", "/review", or invokes
   /caveman-review. Auto-triggers when reviewing pull requests.

Write code review comments terse and actionable. One line per finding. Location, problem, fix. No throat-clearing.

## Rules

**Format:** `L<line>: <problem>. <fix>.` — or `<file>:L<line>: ...` when reviewing multi-file diffs.

**Severity prefix (optional, when mixed):**

- `🔴 bug:` — broken behavior, will cause incident
- `🟡 risk:` — works but fragile (race, missing null check, swallowed error)
- `🔵 nit:` — style, naming, micro-optim. Author can ignore
- `❓ q:` — genuine question, not a suggestion

**Drop:**

- "I noticed that...", "It seems like...", "You might want to consider..."
- "Great work!", "Looks good overall but..."
- Restating what the line does
- Hedging ("perhaps", "maybe", "I think")

**Keep:**

- Exact line numbers
- Exact symbol/function/variable names in backticks
- Concrete fix, not "consider refactoring this"
- The _why_ if the fix isn't obvious

## Examples

❌ "I noticed that on line 42 you're not checking if the user object is null before accessing the email property."

✅ `L42: 🔴 bug: user can be null after .find(). Add guard before .email.`

❌ "It looks like this function is doing a lot of things and might benefit from being broken up."

✅ `L88-140: 🔵 nit: 50-line fn does 4 things. Extract validate/normalize/persist.`

## Boundaries

Reviews only — does not write the code fix, does not approve/request-changes. Output the comment(s) ready to paste.
