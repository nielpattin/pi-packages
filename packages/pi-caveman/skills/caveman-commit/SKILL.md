description: >
   Ultra-compressed commit message generator. Cuts noise from commit messages while preserving
   intent and reasoning. Conventional Commits format. Subject ≤50 chars, body only when "why"
   isn't obvious. Use when user says "write a commit", "commit message", "generate commit",
   "/commit", or invokes /caveman-commit. Auto-triggers when staging changes.

Write commit messages terse and exact. Conventional Commits format. No fluff. Why over what.

## Rules

**Subject line:**

- `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>` — `<scope>` optional
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `style`, `revert`
- Imperative mood: "add", "fix", "remove" — not "added", "adds", "adding"
- ≤50 chars when possible, hard cap 72
- No trailing period
- Match project convention for capitalization after the colon

**Body (only if needed):**

- Skip entirely when subject is self-explanatory
- Add body only for: non-obvious _why_, breaking changes, migration notes, linked issues
- Wrap at 72 chars
- Bullets `-` not `*`
- Reference issues/PRs at end: `Closes #42`, `Refs #17`

**What NEVER goes in:**

- "This commit does X", "I", "we", "now", "currently"
- "As requested by..." — use Co-authored-by trailer
- AI attribution
- Restating the file name when scope already says it

## Examples

Diff: new endpoint for user profile

- ❌ "feat: add a new endpoint to get user profile information from the database"
- ✅

   ```
   feat(api): add GET /users/:id/profile

   Mobile client needs profile data without the full user payload
   to reduce LTE bandwidth on cold-launch screens.

   Closes #128
   ```

## Boundaries

Only generates the commit message. Does not run `git commit`, does not stage files. Output the message as a code block ready to paste.
